WATCHING THIS, WHO ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY AFFECTED SAYING, THERE BUT BY THE GRACE OF GOD GO I. THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. WE HAVE SEEN IT. IT WILL COLOR HAVE BEEN US. WE DON’T LIVE IN THE MOUNTAINS. WE DON’T EXPECT THERE TO BE A RISK THAT A wildfire IS GOING TO CONSUME OUR HOME. BUT HERE WE ARE LOOKING AT JUST THE SUBORNS -- STARBUCKS AND HOMES. 600 PLUS HOUSES. THAT COULD BE A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE. >> BUT THAT’S WHAT LOOKING HERE HALF OF US IN THE METRO ARE IMMEDIATELY IMPACTED AND THE REST OF GOING, THAT COULD BE
DESTROYED SO FAR AND THE fire IS CONTINUING TO BURN. TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE, IT’S POSSIBLY THE MOST DEADLY WILDfire IN COLORADO HISTORY. LAST YEAR THERE WERE 469 STRUCTURES LOST, 224 HOMES. TROUBLE SOME FIRE, 350 STRUCTURES LOST. PINE GULCH, IT WAS THE SIZE OF THE FIRE. THIS FIRES IS 1600 ACRES ONLY SO FAR AND IT IS DEVASTATING ACROSS THE COMMUNITY OF SUPERIOR. WE HAVEN’T HEARD ANYTHING YET ABOUT STRUCTURES LOST IN THE CITY OF LEWISVILLE BUT WE KNOW THEY ARE UNDER A MANDATORY EVACUATION AS WELL. >> CITY OF BOULDER AS WELL. WE’VE NOT HEARD ANY PROBLEMS IN THE CITY OF BOULDER PROPER. YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW, THERE WERE TWO FIRES THAT STARTED THIS WHOLE THING. ONE TO THE NORTH OF BOULDER, MIDDLE FORK, THAT NOW IS REALLY A NON ISSUE. ONLY ONE WE’RE DEALING WITH IS SOUTH OF BOULDER, THE MARSHALL FIRE. I CAN’T GET OVER THESE IMAGES WE’RE SEEING RIGHT NOW.


>> I WANT TO GET IT TO ALAN WHO HAS BEEN FOLLOWING ALONG FOR SEVERAL HOURS. THE LAST TIME WE SAW YOU THREE AMBULANCES WERE RUNNING LIGHTS AND SIREN AS THEY SEEM TO BE HEADING NORTHEAST OUT OF THE fire ZONE. >> LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IS HAPPENING. ARE GOING TO PAN OFF TO ACTIVE FLAMES BEHIND US. THERE IS A VEHICLE PASSING BUT RIGHT THERE YOU CAN SEE HOMES GOING UP RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE EVEN SPOT FIRES BETWEEN HERE AND THERE. I SEE FURTHER GLOW IN THE DISTANCE BEYOND ABOUT. IT LOOKS TO US THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE HOMES IN THAT AREA.


>> WE DON’T HAVE TORI MASON. SHE WAS IN A POSITION WHERE SHE MAY HAVE HAD TO MOVE. WE HAVE VIDEO OF SOME OF THE HUNDREDS OF HOMES THAT HAVE AND BURNED. DO WE HAVE TORI MASON? >> WE WILL GET BACK TO TORI. >> AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER THE WIND IS SO STRONG IT PUSHED THE fire ALL THE WAY ACROSS INDIANA. NONE OF THIS SIDE OF THE STREET WAS ON fire AT ALL. KNOW IT’S YOU YOU ARE ON SO YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE FOLKS A BETTER IDEA WHERE THAT IS? TRAFFIC IS MOVING IN THE DIRECTION. PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET OUT OF HERE AND THE TIME IS LESSENING. WE ARE GETTING OUT OF HERE SOON AS WELL. >> TORI, THANK YOU.
MY PREFERENCE IS THIS TELEVISION STATION. I THINK WE’RE DOING A GOOD JOB. BUT ALSO DO MAKE USE OF OUR WEBSITE, thedenverchannel.com AND OUR DENVER 7 PLUS APP. I THINK YOU’LL FIND IT TERRIBLY USEFUL BECAUSE CONDITIONS ARE CHANGING SO, SO QUICKLY RIGHT NOW. ALSO THE BOULDER OEM.COM FOR THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION OR IF YOU PREFER TO CALL THEM WITH YOUR QUESTIONS, DO NOT CALL 911, PLEASE. 303-413-7730 FOR ALL OF YOUR -- ANYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS FIRE. EVACUATION ROUTES, WHEN YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GO HOME, HOW YOUR HOME IS DOING AND THE STATUS OF EVERYTHING THAT THEY’LL HAVE FOR YOU ON THAT TELEPHONE NUMBER. >> IF YOU’RE CURIOUS TO THE SCALE OF THE fire AND POSSIBLY WHY WE’VE BEEN CUTTING INTO YOUR PROGRAMMING FOR SO LONG, THE SHERIFF’S OFFICE HAS CONFIRMED THERE ARE AT LEAST 600 HOMES


THEY’RE SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED AND ROUTE 228 SERVICE IS SUSPENDED. THE U.S. 36 MC CASLIN STATION IS CLOSED AND THAT’S THE AREA WHERE WE’VE BEEN SHOWING HOMES ON FIRE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT VISTA ADVENTIST HOSPITAL IN LEWISVILLE HAS BEEN EVACUATED FOR STAFF AND PATIENTS BECAUSE THE fire IS GETTING WAY TOO CLOSE AND ALSO SMOKE WAS COMING INTO THE BUILDING SO THEY WERE DEALING WITH THAT. AND AGAIN, IF YOU’RE IN BOULDER COUNTY ANYWHERE NEAR THESE AREAS, PLEASE KEEP UP TO DATE WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. REGISTER FOR THEIR ALERTS BECAUSE THINGS ARE CHANGING RAPIDLY AND AS MIKE JUST SAID, WE WERE EXPECTING WINDS TO DIE DOWN A LOT EARLIER BUT THE FIRE IS CREATING ITS OWN WEATHER SYSTEM AT THIS POINT AND ESSENTIALLY FUELLING ITSELF. >> SO FOR THE VERY LATEST INFORMATION, OF COURSE, LEAVE THE TV ON, OF COURSE.
WILL GO UP. >>> JEFF TODD HAS BEEN REPORTING FROM THE AREA AROUND 88 AND DYLAN ROAD. WE KNOW THE HOSPITAL HAS EVACUATED MANY PEOPLE A TERRIBLE WORKING SITUATION FOR THAT STAFF. >> FOR WHAT WE CAN SEE IT DIDN’T SEEM LIKE THE HOSPITAL SUSTAINED MUCH DAMAGE. CAN’T SAY THAT FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS NORTH OF THE HOSPITAL. TAKE A LOOK. WE HAVE SEEN THIS fire CONTINUE TO MARCH AND BURN HOME AFTER HOME. fire CREWS WORK HERE BUT HAVE SINCE LEFT. THE WIND IS SO STRONG, THE FLAMES ARE SO HOT BUT ONE THING THAT HAS STRUCK ME AS WE HAVE
ARE UNDER WIND AND STORM WARNINGS. UNFORTUNATELY THE SNOW DOESN’T COME IN UNTIL TOMORROW AFTERNOON AS A SHARP COLD FRONT DROPS IN FROM THE NORTHWEST. IT’S GOING TO BE OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL WE’VE HAD ALL SEASON AND THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE WE’VE HAD ALL OUT OF THE SKY SINCE LAST SUMMER, ABOUT THREE TO FIVE INCHES OF SNOW. THE WINDS WILL BEGIN TO EASE. I WISH THEY HAD ABOUT AN HOUR AGO BECAUSE OF THIS fire STORM, IT’S TAKING LONGER FOR THE ATMOSPHERE TO START TO SETTLE DOWN. THERE’S COLDER WEATHER ON THE WAY AND SOME SNOW COMING BUT THAT DOESN’T ARRIVE UNTIL TOMORROW AFTERNOON. CONDITIONS WILL GET BETTER BUT IT REMAINS EXTREMELY ACTIVE AND UNPREDICTABLE SITUATION RIGHT NOW DUE TO THE SIZE AND THE HEAT FROM THIS FIRE. >> THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION. NOT FOR THE CONTENT OF THE THAT’S BAD, BAD NEWS BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH. GLAD YOU’RE WITH US TONIGHT ON THIS TURNING OUT TO BE HISTORIC EVENING HERE IN COLORADO. A COUPLE OF UPDATES.
AREA THAT DOES SHOW SIGNS OF EASING BACKWARD BUT BECAUSE THIS fire IS SO BIG AND SO HOT NOW, IT’S PULLING IN AIR FROM ALL AROUND TO FEED IT. THE OXYGEN FROM THE FIRE. THAT’S WHY WE’RE CONTINUING TO SEE STRONG AND ERRATIC WINDS THAT MAY LAST LONGER THAN UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD HOPED. THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE ON RADAR. THAT IS NOT PRECIPITATION. THAT IS SMOKE AND IT IS VERY, VERY THICK RIGHT THROUGH THE NORTHERN PART OF THE DENVER AREA, SOUTHWESTERN BOULDER COUNTY ALONG BROOMFIELD AND EXTENDING OUT 75 MILES TO THE EAST OF US, OUT ACROSS THE FAR EASTERN PLAINS, OUT TO AKRON. THAT’S HOW FAR TO THE EAST THE SMOKE IS GOING AT THE PRESENT TIME. THERE’S NOT MUCH TO SEE ON RADAR AS FAR AS PRECIPITATION BUT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE COMING OUR WAY. THIS WILL FILL IN SLOWLY BECAUSE THERE’S SO MANY ADVISORIES. WE HAVE EXTREME fire CONDITIONS RIGHT NOW BUT WE’RE ALSO UNDER A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN THE SAME AREA WHILE THE MOUNTAINS
RIGHT OVER WHERE THE fire IS GOING WE HAVE A COLLISION OF STRONG WESTERLY WINDS COMING IN. JUST AFTER THE NOON HOUR WE HAD WINDS UP TO 70 MILE-PER-HOUR FROM BOULDER DOWN TO SUPERIOR. ABOUT 2:00 75 IN BOULDER. THIS AFTERNOON THE WINDS HAVE BEEN STEADILY CLOCKING DOWN. THE PURPLE SHADED AREA IS THE AREA WE COULD STILL SEE THE WIND GUSTS.


IS A CATEGORY TWO, EF2 TORNADO. WHAT WE’VE DEVELOPED IS REALLY A fire STORM. I’M LOOKING AT THIS AND THINKING ABOUT SEEING PICTURES FROM WORLD WAR II, SOME BOMBINGS THAT OCCURRED THERE. THIS fire HAS GOTTEN SO BIG, IT’S NOW CREATING ITS OWN WEATHER AND THAT’S PART OF THE REASON WHY WE’RE NOT SEEING THESE WINDS DIE DOWN. IN THIS TIME LAPSE, YOU CAN SEE THE SMOKE IS JUST ROLLING OFF THE FOOTHILLS. WHAT HAPPENS, RAEMEALLY, WAVES O STRONG WINDS COME IN. WHAT WE HOPED IS AFTER SUNSET, THIS WOULD ALL START TO CALM DOWN A LITTLE BIT. BUT THIS fire IS SO BIG AND SO HOT NOW, IT’S CREATING ITS OWN WEATHER FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE OF HOURS. GUSTS HAVE DROPPED A LITTLE. 46 NOW AT BOULDER BUT WE HOPED THEY WOULD DROP OFF BY AT LEAST HALF THAT AGAIN BY THIS TIME. THEY HAVEN’T YET BUT HERE IS A MAP OVER THE NEXT THREE HOURS OF THE WIND GUSTS, THE STRONGEST IN THE PURPLE AND RED SHOWING UP JUST TO THE WEST OF THE FIRE


MINUTES ONE THAT REALLY REALLY WEIGHS ON YOU. YOU KNOW, WE’VE BEEN SORT OF DRIVING AROUND CHECKING OUT THE AREA WORD TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT. WE’RE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD JUST NORTH OF THE LEWISVILLE WRECK IN SENIOR CENTER. SO THERE’S A LOT OF HOMES UP IN THIS AREA. AND SO WE WE WERE DRIVING THROUGH HERE. I’M ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET TO A SAFER LOCATION. AND IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE LOOKED TO OUR LEFT SO HOMES ON fire THAT THERE WERE NO FIREFIGHTERS AROUND. NO EMERGENCY CREWS AROUND THAT JUST SPEAKS TO THE BREADTH OF THIS fire EMERGENCY HAPPENING UP IN THIS AREA. SO WE DECIDED WE DROVE DOWN THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE NO ONE WAS AND WE ACTUALLY KNOCKED ON THE DOOR OF ONE HOME THAT WE HAD JUST SEEN STARTING TO BE ENGULFED IN THOSE FLAMES JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE WAS HOME. AND THANKFULLY NOBODY ANSWERED THE DOOR, WHICH IS A REALLY GOOD SIGN. THAT THOSE PEOPLE AND ALL OF THEIR NEIGHBORS HOPEFULLY GOT OUT. I MEAN, IT’S IT’S A GHOST TOWN
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS IS A DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINT OF THE FLAMES THAT YOU CAN SEE OFF IN THE DISTANCE. I THINK SLOAN IS JUST A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THAT SUBDIVISION AND AGAIN, DON’T LOSE SIGHT, THIS IS NOT JUST A CLUMP OF A fire OR fire EVENT. THOSE ARE A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL HOMES BURNING RIGHT THERE IN SUPERIOR AT THIS HOUR. >> WE HEARD FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS DIFFERENT MAYORS AND THEY SAY THAT fire RIGHT NOW IS ALL DEPENDENT AND FIGHTING IT IS ALL DEPENDENT ON THE WIND. LET’S GO TO OUR CHIEF METEOROLOGIST MIKE NELSON. WHAT CAN YOU GIVE US IN TERMS OF AN UPDATE IN THE WIND GUSTS? >> NOT A LOT OF GREAT NEWS. THIS IS SOME OF THE HISTORIC GUSTS WE’VE HAD SINCE NOON TODAY. 115 MILES PER HOUR IN ROCKY FLATS, REALLY ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF WHERE THE fire STARTED. WHITE RANCH OPEN SPACE, 103 MILES AN HOUR AND THEN YOU CAN SEE THE HURRICANE FORCE WINDS IN THE BOULDER AREA. KEEP IN MIND 115 MILES AN HOUR


EXPLODING IN SIZE. >> BURPING MORE THAN TWICE THE ACREAGE OF LAST YEAR’S RECORD fire SEASON. >> THEY BE -- >> CATASTROPHIC FLOODS RAVAGE MIDDLE TENNESSEE. >> KNOCKED OFF FOUNDATIONS. JUST FOLT GONE. >> HURRICANE IDA RIPPING THROUGH LOUISIANA. >> THE RAIN -- >> THE REMNANTS OF HURRICANE IDA HAMMERED THE NORTHEAST. >> NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. >> THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE ISSUING A FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY FOR NEW YORK CITY. >> IT WAS FRIGHTENING. >> MANY OF THE VICTIMS DYING IN FLOODED BASEMENTS. >> THE NATION’S DEADLIEST TORNADO OUTBREAK IN MORE THAN A DECADE. >> 88 PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES. >> WE LOST EVERYTHING. WE BASICALLY HAVE NOTHING. >> THE F.D.A. AUTHORIZING THE PFIZER VACCINE FOR 12 TO 15-YEAR-OLDS. >> THE DELTA VARIANT IS SPREADING AND THE HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE GOING UP. >> I’M PUTTING PEOPLE THAT ARE MY AGE AND MY PARENTS’ AGE IN BODY BAGS. >> I WILL NOT GET THAT VACCINE. >> AND A BUSY -- >> WE MUST STOP DENYING THAT THE


POSSIBLY THREATEN THIS AREA. NOW LET’S FAST FORWARD. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY. THEY’RE NEVER PREPARED FOR, NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN HERE. I SPOKE TO A RESIDENT WHO LIVED HERE FOR 30 YEARS AND HE SAID NOTHING HAS EVER COME THIS CLOSE. NO EVACUATIONS OF THIS MAGNITUDE, NO THREAT BY A FIRE STORM OF THIS MAGNITUDE AND REALLY, WE’RE WATCHING A HISTORICAL MOMENT HERE, ONE THAT EVERYBODY WISHES WE COULD AVOID. ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING. I’VE BEEN TALKING TO SOME RESIDENTS AND HEARTBREAKING HAVING TO REPORT ON THIS, LOOKING AT THE IMAGES. I MEAN, COME ON. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. UNBELIEVABLE, GUYS. >> REALLY IS ABSOLUTELY GUT WRENCHING TO WATCH AND I’M SURE, YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY THE HOMEOWNERS BUT fire OFFICIALS PROBABLY FEEL SO HOPELESS KNOWING THERE’S NOT MUCH THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.
RAPIDLY. RIGHT NOW I SEE THE GLOW OF fire BURNING PERHAPS A HALF- MILE TO THE NORTHWEST AT THE MOMENT. >> I WOULDN’T BE SURPRISED. WE KNOW THE HOSPITAL ADVENTIST HAS BEEN EVACUATING SOME PATIENTS. I KNOW THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THEM TO TO OTHER HOSPITALS. PERHAPS THOSE AMBULANCES NOT RESPONDING TO A NEW CALL BUT TRANSPORTING PATIENTS TO OTHER HOSPITALS OUT OF HARMS WAY. >> I THINK THE HOSPITALS IN THAT AREA TO THE SOUTH OF US AND TO THE WEST OF US ARE EVACUATED. THAT HOSPITAL TO THE WEST OF US IS ALL CLEAR. I BELIEVE THOSE ARE TWO HER WOULD BE BECAUSE THEY EVACUATED AT THE SAME TIME. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS PANDEMONIUM TRYING TO GET
WOULD PRESUME POSSIBLY HUNDREDS OF MORE ONCE THAT SMOKE CLEARS. WE’VE BEEN MONITORING THE TRAFFIC HERE AS WELL BECAUSE THIS FIRE, YOU KNOW, HAS BEEN MOVING CLOSER TO US. REALLY THE STOP AND GO ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. IT’S GOTTEN A LITTLE BETTER NOW BUT EVERYBODY CAN’T HELP BUT TO PULL OVER ALONG THE 128 HERE WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE ROCK CREEK COMMUNITY BECAUSE HOW COULD YOU NOT? IT’S ABSOLUTE DEVASTATION. IT’S THE KIND OF WRATH THAT I DON’T THINK I’VE EVER SEEN AND I’VE COVERED A LOT OF WILDFIRES COMING FROM CALIFORNIA. I’VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. AND YOU KNOW, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES WITH SOME OF THE OTHER FIRES WE’VE SEEN, THOSE FOLKS KNOW, HEY, WE CAN BE EVACUATED. THESE SUPERIOR RESIDENTS THAT WE’VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON. THEY JUST KNOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAME TO THEIR HOME, PACK YOUR BAGS. THERE MAY BE A WILDfire THAT CAN
TO HOME LIKE THIS IT’S SOMETHING ELSE. ERIC, I’LL TELL YOU THAT IT’S VERY DIFFERENT THAN THAT FIRE, WHICH OF OCCURRED AND WAS ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE IN SIZE. BUT SUCH A DIFFERENT A GEOGRAPHIC WITH FAR FEWER HOMES, HOMES THAT ARE MORE SPREAD OUT EASIER TO DEFEND. AND THIS SITUATION HERE, IT JUST MOVED INTO THE SUBDIVISIONS AND IT’S NOT HARD FATHOM. WHY WYATT WHY IT CONTINUES TO GROW AND WHY FIREFIGHTERS HAVE HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING GETTING AHEAD OF THIS fire BECAUSE WE’VE SEEN A JUMP FROM ONE HOUSE TO THE NEXT IN JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES. HONESTLY, AND AND THIS SITE WE’RE LOOKING AT NOW, I CAN COUNT AT LEAST 8 HOMES IN THIS SUBDIVISION THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON FIRE. AND THAT’S NOT TO MENTION THE ONES THAT WERE BURNING ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. FURTHER NORTH WEST OF THIS fire SO, YEAH, A VERY DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION AND, YOU KNOW, LISTEN, I’VE I’VE TONS OF
THERE. JUST ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING. 30 MINUTES AGO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOME EMBERS AND SOME OF THE SPOT FIRES WE WERE SEEING. NOW THERE ARE ENTIRE COMMUNITIES COMPLETELY ENGULFED BY THIS HELLISH INFERNO. WE SAW ONE HOME CATCH ON FIRE AND THEN A TREE CATCH ON FIRE AND THEN WITH THE RELENTLESS GUSTS, CONTINUOUS FOR HOURS, WE HAVE BASICALLY SEEN THIS ENTIRE COMMUNITY BECOME THE VICTIM OF THIS fire AND IT’S NOT STOPPING ANY TIME SOON. IF WE JUST PAN TO THE RIGHT, EVEN MORE HOMES OFF TO THE RIGHT EAST OF THE ROCK CREEK COMMUNITY ARE CATCHING ON fire AND ALL NIGHT LONG, WE HAVE RESIDENTS UP HERE ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED, IN TEARS WONDERING WHETHER ONE OF THEIR HOMES HAS FALLEN VICTIM TO THIS INFERNO. THE GOVERNOR SAID HUNDREDS OF HOMES ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED AND I
BURNING WAY OUT THERE. WE ARE AT 96th AND DYLAN. SAW THE fire COME UP VERY CLOSE WHICH REALLY WAS CAUSING PROBLEMS WITH SPOT FIRES HERE AND EVERYWHERE. THEY DID BRING IN ADDITIONAL CREWS. DENVER fire SHOWED UP. A BUNCH OF fire ENGINES ROLLED IN. THAT WAS IN ADDITION TO THE WILDLAND FIRES. WITH THE WIND COMING AT YOU IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE. THEY WILL GET THE WATER. IN THIS AREA WE KNOW HOMES ARE LOST TO THE WEST OF US. PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE AREA ARE TELLING STORIES OF DRIVING THROUGH AREAS. WE COULD BARELY SEE THE VEHICLE IN FRONT IF THERE WAS A VEHICLE A FEW FEET IN FRONT. THEY PASS BURNING HOMES. I TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO HELPED
RINGER THIS YEAR. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT THE KING SOOPERS UP THE ROAD IN BOULDER AND THEY HAVE SEEN MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE OF THE CERTAINLY NOT THE WAY THEY WANTED TO END 2021. I DON’T KNOW IF YOU CAN STILL HEAR I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY AND VIVIDLY WHEN WE WERE COVERING THE WILDFIRES LAST YEAR IN 2020. YOU ARE OUT THERE LIVE FOR US COVERING SOME OF THOSE BUT EVER MEMBER, YOU KNOW, WE SHOWED ONE HOME OFF INTO THE DISTANCE. >> THAT WAS BURNING. THIS MUST FEEL ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FOR YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE WATCHING UNFOLD RIGHT NOW FROM YOUR LIVE PICTURE. >> YEAH, IT’S A COMPLETELY SCENARIO THAT JUST NORTH OF GRANBY. I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE THAT THE EAST TROUBLESOME FIRE FLARED AND WE WATCHED AS THE FLAMES MOVED ACROSS THE HILL TOWARDS ONE HOME ON TOP OF A HILL. AND THAT WAS A HEARTBREAKING IN ITS OWN. RIGHT. AND NOW HERE WE ARE ON TOP OF ANOTHER HERE LATER. AND IT’S MOVING IN ON THOUSANDS OF HOMES TO WATCH IT GO FROM HOME


KNOW, METRO AREA THAT’S ON FIRE THIS EVENING THAT WE’RE REPORTING ON. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU JUST HOPE THAT MOTHER NATURE WILL GIVE THESE FIRST RESPONDERS A BREAK EVENTUALLY. >> THIS WILILILILILDfire SMALL I COMPARISON TO LAST YEAR BUT BECAUSE OF WHERE IT IS AT, BECAUSE IT IS THE AREA OF SUBURBIA, IT’S JUST IMPACTING SO MANY FAMILIES RIGHT NOW WHERE IT’S POTENTIALLY THOUSANDS. >> THERE’S HELP COMING TONIGHT. NATIONAL GUARD. RUSSELL, THANK YOU. TAKE A BREAK. HEAVEN KNOWS YOU DESERVE IT. WE’LL CHECK IN WITH YOU THROUGHOUT THE EVENING. NICE WORK TO ALL THE CREWS TODAY. THERE IS HELP ARRIVING THIS EVENING. NATIONAL GUARD HAS BEEN ACTIVATED AND HAS BEEN DEPLOYED AND THEY’RE GOING TO COME FOR THE NIGHT SHIFT TO HELP WITH TRAFFIC, WITH ANYTHING EXTRA THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THAT WILL TAKE IT OFF THE PLATE OF LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS. >> fire CREWS FROM AROUND THE STATE AS WELL HAVE BEEN JOINING IN THE EFFORT AS WELL AS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM AROUND


THESE ARE MASSIVE HOMES THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE HERE IN THE MORNING. >> OH MY GOSH! SO, SO SAD TO SEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. STAY SAFE. WITH A THAT NOT JUST TO OUR CRUISE BUT EVERYBODY IN THE SITUATION TONIGHT. IF YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE IN THE fire STRICKEN AREAS GET OUT IF YOU HAVEN’T DONE THAT ALREADY. WE WANT TO SEND IT TO ALAN JINNI. ALLEN, YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE HOWLING WINDS. WHAT IS THE LATEST ON ALL OF THE SPOT GRASS FIRES? >> THEY HAVE BEEN POPPING UP AND POPPING UP. I WILL SHOW YOU WAY BEHIND US IN THE DISTANCE. YOU CAN SEE THE FIRES BURNING OFF IN THE DISTANCE RIGHT HERE. I HAVE FEEDBACK COMING BACK HERE. THAT IS THE GLOW OF FIRES


LOUISVILLE? TORI THERE IS SOMETHING ON FIRE BEHIND YOU THERE. >> THERE ARE QUITE A FEW THINGS ON fire BEHIND ME. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. EVERY HOME I COULD SEE IN THE DISTANCE IS ON fire AND THE WINDS ARE SO STRONG. IT KEEPS PUSHING THE fire TO EACH AND EVERY HOME. THE SUN EVER HAD MAY GO UP IN FLAMES.


HAVE SEEN THIS fire OVER THE PAST 30, 40 MINUTES. JUMP FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE MOVING OFF FROM WEST TO EAST THROUGH THIS SUBDIVISION DIRECTLY BELOW US. WE ARE ON HIGHWAY ONE. 28 NEAR INDIANA, LOOKING NORTH. SO WE ARE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF SUPERIOR. AGAIN, THE FIRE EARLIER MOVED ACROSS THE TOWARDS MCCASLIN. WE SAW GET CLOSE TO THESE HOMES. THEN FOR A MINUTE, IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT MOVE THE OTHER WAY. BUT EVENTUALLY IT GOT INTO THIS SUBDIVISION. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY DIFFICULT TO WATCH, AS IT JUMPS FROM HOME TO HOME TO HOME MOVING WEST TO EAST. WE HAVE SEEN FIRST RESPONDERS FLYING THROUGH THIS SUBDIVISION ALL AFTERNOON TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THERE. AND THEY REMAIN IN THERE RIGHT NOW. WE CAN SEE FLASHING LIGHTS VERY CLOSE TO A FEW OF THOSE HOMES THAT ARE ON fire RIGHT NOW. THEY APPEAR TO BE ON THE EASTERN EDGE OF THAT HOME ON fire RIGHT THERE. OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO GET ANYONE OUT TO MAYBE IS STILL IN THIS
WE ARE A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY AND WE CAN DO A BIT OF THE HEAT. YOU CAN SEE AS WE LOOK INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, MANY OF THESE HOMES COMPLETELY TAKEN DOWN FROM THE FOUNDATION. ONE THING THAT IS NEW THAT WE ARE SEEING IS A LOT OF THE SMOKE IS NOW CLEARING THE AREA. WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH THIS DRAINAGE AND WE ARE LOOKING ACROSS AT SOME HOMES IN LOUISVILLE. SHE MANY PEOPLE WINDOW THE UNIQUE INTERSECTION THERE ARE A LOT OF RESTAURANTS AND A MOVIE THEATER IN THE AREA AND WE CAN SEE BURNING IN THE AREA. AS MUCH AS THIS fire BURNED THROUGH THE TOWN OF SUPERIOR MUCH MANAGE WILL BE ASSESSED TOMORROW IN THE TOWN OF
WHO ARE WATCHING RIGHT NOW, WATCHING THEIR HOMES, YOU KNOW, BECOME VICTIMS OF THIS DEVASTATING AND CATASTROPHIC WILDfire THAT WE’VE SEEN HERE IN BOULDER COUNTY. IT’S JUST DEVASTATING AND IT CONTINUES HERE INTO THE EVENING HOURS SINCE WE’RE NOT GETTING, AT THE MOMENT, NO RELIEF FROM THE WIND. >> WHAT’S A WHOLE BALLGAME RIGHT NOW. THE SHERIFF SAID IT, GOVERNOR SAID IT, EVERYBODY SAID IT. WE’RE WAITING FOR THE WIND HERE. THERE’S NOT MUCH THEY CAN DO UNTIL THE WIND DIES DOWN. WHAT STRIKES ME, JESSICA AS WELL, IS THAT EARLY IN OUR COVERAGE, WE SAW A PHOTO OF A HOME ON FIRE. AND OUR BREATH WAS TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE THIS POOR FAMILY JUST LOST THEIR HOME. WE’RE SEEING HUNDREDS AS WE COME ROUTINE NOW THROUGHOUT THE EVEN TO GO SEE CLUSTERS OF HOMES AND NEIGHBORHOODS GO UP IN FLAMES. IT’S LIKE 600 OR SO KNOWN HOMES RIGHT NOW ARE GONE BETWEEN LATE THIS MORNING AND RIGHT NOW.
I HAVE BEEN OUT HERE SINCE ABOUT ONE A CLOCK THIS AFTERNOON IN THESE WINS ARE STILL AS STRONG AS I HAVE FELT ALL DAY. WE CAME TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THE HOSPITAL WAS IN SOME DANGER. THE GOOD NEWS IS IT SEEMS IF THE HOSPITAL HAS ANY DAMAGE IT WILL BE VERY MINIMAL. THIS NEIGHBORHOOD TO THE NORTH IS COMPLETELY DECIMATED. WE HAVE WATCHED HOMES BURNED DOWN TO THE FOUNDATION AND WE HAVE WATCHED THESE FLAMES CONTINUE TO MARCH TO THE EAST. THESE HOMES YOU ARE SEEING THAT ARE BURNING RIGHT NOW WERE NOT ON fire ABOUT 20-25 MINUTES AGO BUT fire CREWS HAVE LEFT THE SCENE KNOWING THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO TRY TO SAVE THESE HOMES BECAUSE THE WIND IS TOO STRONG AND QUITE FRANKLY THE fire IS TOO HOT.
BLACK FOREST fire WAS ACTUALLY 511 HOMES THAT BURNED AND 11,000 ACRES. YOU GUYS JUST SAID THIS ONE IS AT 580 GOES TO THE DENSITY AND THE FLAMES THAT HAVE BEEN FANNED OUT THERE. NOW, I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, GREG NIETO JUST SHOWED US YOU. IT’S STILL WINDY FOLKS, BUT WE ARE STARTING TO SEE ONE THING. THE STRONGEST WINDS ARE NOW AS WE EXPECTED, STARTING TO RETREAT UP THE HIGHER TERRAIN. SO WE’RE STILL FEELING IT HERE NEAR THE FIRE. THAT’S NOT SURPRISING. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT AS ITS FANNING THE FLAMES THERE WITH THOSE 4 HOMES THAT ARE BURNING. BUT HERE’S WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU CAN SEE THE WIND SPEEDS. THEY’RE STARTING TO RETREAT. SO THE STRONGEST WIND NOW THAT WILL BE ON SUNSET IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO MARCH UP THE FOOT HILLS. IT’S STILL GOING TO TAKE A WHILE BEFORE THE WIND KIND OF RELAX SAYS IT WILL NEVER GO CALM BECAUSE WE HAVE AN APPROACHING STORM SYSTEM. SO SPEEDS OVERNIGHT. I WAS LOOKING AT FUTURECAST. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS. YOU CAN SEE THE WIND SPEEDS OVERNIGHT NOW ARE AWAY FROM THE fire WOULD HAVE GONE UP. THE FOOTHILLS STILL WINDY ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF TOWN BY 11 O’CLOCK. TONIGHT. AND THEN THE WINDS TOMORROW,


FIRE. EARLIER WE DID SEE SOME FIRE CREWS TRYING TO GET OUT THAT fire WHEN IT STILL LOOKED LIKE A HOME. AS YOU CAN SEE THE WINDS ARE STILL MOVING. THAT CONTINUES TO MOVE DOWN EAST THAT WAY. AGAIN, WHEN WE WERE DRIVING DOWN THE AREA IT FELT LIKE A GHOST TOWN. THERE ARE NEIGHBORS WALKING BACK AND FORTH TRYING TO SCOPE OUT AND SEE WHAT IS MAYBE LEFT OF THEIR HOMES. I DID SPEAK WITH A MAN WHO HAD A HOME AT THE CORNER. WE HAVE BEEN HERE THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK OVER TO MY LEFT HAND SIDE THERE


OF FOR SURE. THE GOVERNOR TRIED TO PUT THIS FIRE. WHAT WE’RE DEALING WITH TONIGHT INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR US BECAUSE HE MENTION. >> THE WILDFIRES THAT WE DEALT WITH BACK IN 2020 WHERE THEY WERE MASSIVE WILDFIRES. WE’RE TALKING ABOUT 200 PLUS 20,000 PLUS ACRES. HOWEVER, IT WAS IN A MORE PART OF COLORADO. AND SO IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL STRUCTURAL DAMAGE, IT WAS FAR LESS MINUSCULE COMPARED TO WHAT WE’RE SEEING UNFOLD RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES LIFE TONIGHT. >> NO MATTER WHAT CAMERA WE TAKE LIVE, IT’S THE SAME VIEW. AND THAT IS HOMES BEING DESTROYED EVEN AS WE SPEAK. SOMEBODY POINTED OUT TO ME EARLIER, IT’S JUST HEARTBREAKING THAT IN SOME OF THE SHOTS YOU’VE BEEN SEEN CHRISTMAS LIGHTS IN THE FOREGROUND. HOMES BURNING IN THE BACKGROUND. WHAT A MISERABLE TIME OF YEAR TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN AS WE SEE A BIG EXPLOSION OF FLAMES RIGHT HERE. THIS AGAIN, THE AREA ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF SUPERIOR NOT FAR FROM MCCASLIN SOUTH OF US, 36 AND NOT FAR FROM THE BUSINESSES AND HOMES THAT WERE DESTROYED EARLIER IN THIS fire AGAIN CONFIRMED 500,
OF US. AGAIN, THOSE IMAGES JUST HAUNTING SO MANY HOMES ON FIRE. YOU HEARD THE BOULDER PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF HOMES LOST. AND AT THIS HOUR, I’M JUST GUESSING THAT WE’RE LOOKING AT LEAST A DOZEN HOMES, A MILE OR SO SOUTH OF US JUST GOING UP IN FLAMES TONIGHT AND ALL I CAN TO GET OUT OF THOSE FAMILIES THAT HAD TO EVACUATE AND THE UNBELIEVABLE LOSS THAT THEY MUST BE FEELING. AND THIS WIND JUST WILL NOT DIE DOWN. WE’VE BEEN THINKING. FOR HOURS THAT ONCE WE GET TO NIGHTFALL, THE WIND WILL DIE DOWN. IT HASN’T HAPPENED. AND THE WIND JUST KEEPS KICKING FROM WEST TO EAST. AND THE fire IS JUST UNRELENTING AS A RESULT, A REALLY DEPRESSING DAY AND NOW AN AWFUL LONG NIGHT FOR EVERYONE IN BOULDER COUNTY CHAIRMAN ERICA. >> YEAH, YOU KNOW, OF MAYOR AND THE GOVERNOR SHOULD SAY POLIS SAID THERE’S NO WAY TO QUANTIFY THE PRICE OF THIS LOSS. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FAMILY HEIRLOOMS AND THE MENTORS THAT HAVE GONE UP IN FLAMES YEAH. AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF HEARTBREAK TONIGHT IN THOSE COLORADO COMMUNITIES
THIS MORNING. IT STARTED ABOUT 10:30 AND THAT MAY HAVE STARTED BOTH FIRES IN THE AREA. NOW, THE MIDDLE FORK FIRE, THE FIRST fire THAT STARTED ABOUT 10:30 THIS MORNING, THAT’S THE ONE NORTH OF BOULDER, AND THEY SAID THAT ONE HAS BEEN CONTAINED AND NO LONGER REALLY AN ISSUE BUT IT IS THE fire THAT IS BURNING SOUTH OF BOULDER, THAT IS THE MARSHAL fire THAT’S ABOUT 1600 ACRES NOW AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT’S BEEN BURNING OUT OF CONTROL. THE MAYOR AS WELL AS THE SHERIFF SAID THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT PRIOR FIGHTERS ARE SIMPLY NOT ABLE TO GET TO. SUBDIVISIONS AND NEIGHBORHOODS THEY’RE NOT ABLE TO GET TO RIGHT NOW AND THEY KNOW THERE ARE HOMES BURNING. THEY’RE FIGHTING THE fire THAT’S BEEN DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF HIGH WINDS. THEY CAN’T HAVE ANY AIR SUPPORT RIGHT NOW. THERE’S NO TANKERS TO DROP WATER ON THE AREAS AND TRY TO GET THIS UNDER CONTROL SO THEY’RE TRYING TO FIGHT IT HEAD ON AND THEY QUITE FRANKLY CANNOT DO SO. THEY SAID FIGHTING THE fire IS
OR fire RELATED INJURIES AT THIS POINT, THE BOULDER SHERIFF, THEY’RE VERY CAREFUL TO SAY THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THERE ARE INJURIES AND THERE ARE ONCE WE HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT’S HAPPENING HERE AFTER THIS EVENT IS OVER, SAID THAT THAT THAT IS TOUGH TO HEAR HIM SAY. ALSO TOUGH TO HEAR IT. THEY WON’T GET REAL GOOD BEAD ON BETTER CONDITIONS, PERHAPS UNTIL TOMORROW WHEN THAT MOISTURE FINALLY COMES IN. SO WE COULD BE A LONG NIGHT HERE IN BOULDER COUNTY FOR SURE. OUR ROB LOWE, ONE OF OUR TEAM OF REPORTERS LIVE UP THERE RIGHT NOW. ROB, WHAT’S HAPPENING WHERE YOU ARE? >> JEREMY, I’M STANDING JUST OUT OF FRAME NEXT. A PHOTOJOURNALIST MIKE ROBERTS AND THE PICTURES KIND OF SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES AS REALLY ONE OF THE SIDE OF SITES HAVE EVER SEEN. AS YOU SAW POLICE CAR DRIVE DOZENS OF HOMES CURRENTLY BURNING JUST SOUTH OF BOULDER JUST WEST OF CHERRYVILLE ROAD. SO WE ARE IN BOULDER JUST ABOUT A QUARTER MILE WEST OF THE BOULDER VALLEY CHRISTIAN CHURCH THAT WE HAD TO EVACUATE ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO AND TO THE SOUTH
NEWS, AN ENTIRE SUBDIVISION DESTROYED THE SAGAMORE SUBDIVISION 300, 70 HOMES WIPED OUT ON THE WEST SIDE OF TOWN. ANOTHER 210 DESTROYED IN OLD TOWN SUPERIOR. THE TARGET STORE COMPLEX ON FIRE. THE ELEMENT HOTEL, THE ONLY HOTEL IN THE TOWN OF SUPERIOR DESTROYED AND THIS OMINOUS SIGN. I’M GOING TO SIGN AS WE LOOK LIVE THE NIGHT SKY, A GLOW FROM HOMES BURNING STILL AT THIS HOUR. YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE IT WAS ONE OF THE MAYOR’S THERE WHO SPOKE THAT SAID. >> THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE IN NEED AND IN CRISIS TONIGHT SAYING THIS HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC EVENT AS WE SEE AS THESE HOMES IN THIS SUBDIVISION, IN SUPERIOR UP IN FLAMES RIGHT NOW. SOME OF THE NUMBERS THAT WE GOT FROM OFFICIALS HERE THAT fire IS ABOUT 1600 ACRES. AND ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT THAT I WANT TO GET TO REALLY QUICKLY AS OF RIGHT NOW, THERE IS ONE REPORT OF AN OFFICER WHO WAS HURT FROM FLYING DEBRIS AND THERE ARE NO fire RELATED CASUALTIES
